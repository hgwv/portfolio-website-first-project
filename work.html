        <p>well, i can code in java, python, html, and i'm currently learning javascript and css (which is why this website has quite literally barely any interaction OR style, so sorry about that!) i'm looking for internships and work in general to build experience, so hit me up if you have any openings! you can find my contact info if you go back to the home page and get my email from there :)</p>
